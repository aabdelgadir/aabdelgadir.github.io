Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of Pittsburgh. 

I study Islamic identity and politics of Islam in Muslim-minority contexts. In the African context, my research focuses on the emergence of conservative Islamic ideas and traces their effects on social identity and group outcomes. The centerpiece of this research agenda is my book manuscript, Foreign Seeds of Conservative Islam: How transnational networks remade religion in Africa, which I am revising after a book workshop held in June 2025. In the European context, I am interested in the prospects for the inclusion of Muslim communities in an increasingly diverse continent. Published and ongoing work investigates how institutional and societal conditions influence the status and identities of Muslim minorities.

Prior to my current position, I was a Presidential Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Department of Politics at Princeton University. I obtained my PhD in Political Science at Stanford University in 2021 and earned a BA in political science at Yale University.
